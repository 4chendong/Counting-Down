<p>Hi! It's been a while since we met each other, how are you doing in these days?
Needless to say, you must've been taking good care of yourself, as any other girl with enough inner-strength have always been doing. I like this kind of girls, they are gorgeous.</p>

<a id="meet-and-desire" class="anchor" href="#meet-and-desire" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Meet and Desire</h3>

<p>Do you remember the first day we met?
Want to know what I felt like when I saw you?</p>

<p>You are A little bit shy, with ... nice outlooking.</p>

<p>And when I tried to get to know more about you.
You show me your self-confidence and good taste.</p>

<p>By the way, I really like you voice.</p>

<p>In those days, I dare not say I began to dream of kindling any long-term relationships (maybe good friendship, Ahhhh...ha....) between us, but I firmly believed that I will feel sorry if I just let you pass by.</p>
