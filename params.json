It's been a while since we met each other, how are you doing in these days?\r\nNeedless to say, you must've been taking good care of yourself, as any other girl with enough inner-strength have always been doing. I like this kind of girls, they are gorgeous.\r\n\r\n### Meet and Desire\r\nDo you remember the first day we met?\r\nWant to know what I felt like when I saw you?\r\n\r\nYou are A little bit shy, with ... nice outlooking.\r\n\r\nAnd when I tried to get to know more about you.\r\nYou show me your self-confidence and good taste.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I really like you voice.\r\n\r\nIn those days, I dare not say I began to dream of kindling any long-term relationships (maybe good friendship, Ahhhh...ha....) between us, but I firmly believed that I will feel sorry if I just let you pass by.\r\n\r\n### Tic Toc\r\n",
